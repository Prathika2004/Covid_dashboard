This project contains data analysis and visualization work based on multiple datasets, including category distributions, percentage contributions, and case trends. It covers 53 combinations of Column2 values with percentage contributions from Column5, 55 grouped entries showing the frequency distribution of Column3 by Column5, and detailed distributions for Column1 (57 values), Column2 (42 values), Column3 (36 values), and Column5 (27 values). Additionally, it includes 57 records representing the current distribution of COVID-19 cases across U.S. states. Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive view of category spread, contribution patterns, and real-world case data, supported by clear and insightful visualizations.
